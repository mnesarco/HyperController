## 3D Model

This directory contains a FreeCAD file: `base1.FCStd` which is an enclosure prototype. It was created with **FreeCAD 0.19_pre+**, **Assembly4**, and **Mnesarco Utils**, so in order to open it, you need to have those installed.

There is also a script file: `vars.py` which contains main parameters of the enclosure, it must be in the same directory of `base1.FCStd`, so if you download `base1.FCStd` remember to download also `vars.py` and put both in the same directory.
